    			These individuals happen to not have existed on their own. 
    			They are peopleâ€™s loved one, family but due to the menace that is happening in our society their 
    			memories are often reduced to labels by the media and press such as; "an 18-year-old teen was shot", 
    			"gunshot claims the life of a young man/lady" etc.

				<p>
				This ends up with no one knowing who they were or the impact they had with exception of the 
				people in their circles/communities
